This code sends an SMS message using the Twilio API. You will need to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID, YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN, YOUR_TWILIO_NUMBER, and +1234567890 with your actual Twilio account credentials and the phone number you want to send the message to. The $message variable contains the message you want to send.

Note that you will also need to have the cURL library installed on your server to use this code.
